Permission issues with Puppeteer (especially when initializing multiple instances in different directories) typically stem from how Puppeteer downloads and caches Chromium, or how pnpm handles dependencies. Here’s how to diagnose and fix it:
Common Causes & Solutions
1. Puppeteer’s Chromium Download Permissions

    Issue: Puppeteer downloads Chromium to a shared cache directory (e.g., ~/.cache/puppeteer). If one instance fails, it can corrupt permissions for others.

    Fix:

        Explicitly set a custom cache directory for each bot:
        bash

PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR="./.puppeteer_cache" pnpm add puppeteer

Or configure it in your script:
ts

        const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
          cacheDirectory: './.puppeteer_cache',
        });

2. PNPM’s Strict Dependency Isolation

    Issue: pnpm uses a global store (default: ~/.pnpm-store), and symlinks dependencies. Puppeteer might clash if multiple projects try to access the same store.

    Fix:

        Use pnpm’s shamefully-hoist (if Puppeteer needs hoisted binaries):
        Add to .npmrc:
        ini

shamefully-hoist=true

Or run pnpm install with --independent-leafs:
bash

        pnpm install --independent-leafs

3. System Permission Conflicts

    Issue: If running as root or with sudo, Puppeteer may fail (it deliberately blocks privileged execution for security).

    Fix:

        Avoid sudo with pnpm. Instead, fix ownership of node_modules:
        bash

sudo chown -R $(whoami) ./node_modules

Or use --unsafe-perm (not recommended):
bash

        pnpm add puppeteer --unsafe-perm

4. Concurrent Puppeteer Instances

    Issue: Multiple bots trying to launch Chromium simultaneously may collide.

    Fix:

        Use puppeteer-cluster for managing instances:
        bash

        pnpm add puppeteer-cluster

        Or stagger launches with delays.

Recommended Setup for Multiple Bots

    Isolate Each Bot:

        Give each bot its own directory with a dedicated node_modules and .puppeteer_cache.

        Example structure:

    /bots
      /bot-js
        /.puppeteer_cache
        /node_modules
        package.json
      /bot-ts
        /.puppeteer_cache
        /node_modules
        package.json

Use Environment Variables:
Add to each bot’s package.json:
json

"scripts": {
  "start": "PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR=.puppeteer_cache ts-node src/index.ts"
}

Clean Up Between Runs:
bash

    rm -rf .puppeteer_cache && pnpm install

Debugging Steps

    Check Puppeteer’s download path:
    bash

pnpm exec puppeteer --dump-browsers

Verify pnpm store location:
bash

pnpm config get store-dir

Run with verbose logging:
bash

    DEBUG="puppeteer:*" pnpm start

TL;DR

    Isolate caches (set PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR per bot).

    Avoid sudo and fix filesystem permissions.

    Use shamefully-hoist if Puppeteer complains about missing binaries.

    Stagger launches if running bots concurrently.
